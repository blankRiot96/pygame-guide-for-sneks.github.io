    <p>In this article, we'll go over how to get a basic window running.</p>

    <h2>Table of contents</h2>

      </ol>
    </p>


    <h2><a id="setup" class="js">Setup</a></h2>
    <p>
        Create a file, for the purposes of this article I'll be calling it <code>main.py</code>.
        Avoid calling it <code>pygame.py</code> as that would result in a circular import error.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now obviously, the first thing to do is to import the library
{% highlight python %}
import pygame
{% endhighlight %}
    </p>
    <p>
      As a general practice, we generally initialize pygame before using it. This enables the use of
      audio, fonts, and other cool stuff that we don't have to remember to initialize individually
{% highlight python %}
import pygame

pygame.init()
{% endhighlight %}
    </p>

    <p>
      Now here comes the interesting stuff, 
      we're gonna spawn a window!
{% highlight python %}
import pygame

pygame.init()
pygame.display.set_mode(size=(500, 500))
{% endhighlight %}

You probably didn't see it, but that opened a 500x500 (width x height) window
and closed since the program terminated. 
</p>
<p>
In order to keep the window open, the Python process needs to be running. 
Let's make a while loop to keep it running
<br><u><b>CAUTION</b></u>: Make sure you know how to end your Python program forcefully, as the Window will be unresponsive</b>.
If you're running this from a terminal, using CTRL+C or CTRL+SHIFT+C will do
{% highlight python %}
import pygame

pygame.init()
pygame.display.set_mode(size=(500, 500))

while True:
    pass
{% endhighlight %}
    </p>

    <p>
      Great! Now we've got a black window running, but it's unresponsive. Let's fix that, shall we?
{% highlight python %}
import pygame

pygame.init()
pygame.display.set_mode(size=(500, 500))

while True:
    events = pygame.event.get()
    for event in events:
        pass 
{% endhighlight %}
      <br><code>events = pygame.event.get()</code>: Here, we're requesting
      the events that happened since the previous time <code>pygame.event.get</code> was called. 
      So any keypress, mouse input or touch input was recorded here.
      <br>
      <br>In this case, we want to loop over these events and check if the user pressed the X button.
      <code>pygame.QUIT</code> is sent when the user closes the window
{% highlight python %}
import pygame

pygame.init()
pygame.display.set_mode(size=(500, 500))

while True:
    events = pygame.event.get()
    for event in events:
        if event.type == pygame.QUIT:
            pass
{% endhighlight %}
      <br><code>if event.type == pygame.QUIT</code>:
      So the <code>.type</code> attribute of each event is how we determine 
      what the type of each event is. This maps to an integer constant and is usually compared with a named constant 
      within pygame like <code>.QUIT</code>

{% highlight python %}
import pygame

pygame.init()
pygame.display.set_mode(size=(500, 500))

while True:
    events = pygame.event.get()
    for event in events:
        if event.type == pygame.QUIT:
            raise SystemExit 
{% endhighlight %}
      <br><code>raise SystemExit</code>: Well, this is pretty self explanatory.
      This simply raises a system exit, which terminates the Python program, and as we know - 
      that causes the window to close
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      Now what if we want to draw something onto the window?
      <br>In order to do that, let's first get the display <a href="https://pyga.me/docs/ref/surface.html">Surface</a>. 
      <br>A surface is basically a canvas we can draw pixels on, and the display 
      surface is the main canvas which represents the area on our window.
    </p>
    <p>
      The display surface is returned by the <code>display.set_mode</code> function,
      let's assign that to a variable.
{% highlight python %}
import pygame

pygame.init()
screen = pygame.display.set_mode(size=(500, 500))

while True:
    events = pygame.event.get()
    for event in events:
        if event.type == pygame.QUIT:
            raise SystemExit
{% endhighlight %}
      
      In pygame, it is common to name this variable 'screen'. Let's go ahead and fill the 
      display surface, i.e, 'screen' with a color. 
{% highlight python %}
import pygame

pygame.init()
screen = pygame.display.set_mode(size=(500, 500))

while True:
    events = pygame.event.get()
    for event in events:
        if event.type == pygame.QUIT:
            raise SystemExit

    screen.fill("blue")
{% endhighlight %}

      <code>Surface.fill</code> lets you fill the entire surface/canvas with a color of your choice.
    </p>

    <p>
      But hey, this didn't do anything? The window is still black! 
      <br>The reason for this is that we need to tell the window to update itself each time we draw
      something onto it. We can do that with <code>pygame.display.flip()</code>
{% highlight python %}
import pygame

pygame.init()
screen = pygame.display.set_mode(size=(500, 500))

while True:
    events = pygame.event.get()
    for event in events:
        if event.type == pygame.QUIT:
            raise SystemExit

    screen.fill("blue")
    pygame.display.flip()
{% endhighlight %}

      And voila! We have a perfectly good pygame window running
    </p>
