  <p>In this article, we'll go over what pygame is and how to install it.</p>

  <h2><a id="introduction" class="js">Introduction</a></h2>
  <p>
    It's time to get started on your pygame journey, but what is pygame? Well
    pygame is "a free and open-source cross-platform library for the development
    of multimedia applications like video games using Python"(<a href="https://github.com/pygame-community/pygame-ce?tab=readme-ov-file">pygame-ce github repository</a>). As the
    description suggests, it's mostly used to make video games - which is why in
    this book we'll be learning techniques relevant to making games
  </p>

  <p>
    Pygame aims to be a user-friendly library to draw and manipulate pixels onto
    the screen, much like <a href="https://www.libsdl.org/">SDL2</a>, but with
    extended features in various forms that makes it easier to use. Given this
    nature, you generally have a lot of control on how you want your code to
    run, so it may have a bit of a learning curve. But fear not! After reading
    this book you should be able to use pygame just fine, as long as you get
    your practice in ðŸ”«
  </p>

  <p>
    In this book we'll aim to cover how to do basic things with pygame, with
    little exercises in between to make sure you're not falling off
    
    Good Luck!
  </p>

  <h2><a id="pygame-ce" class="js">Pygame-CE</a></h2>
  <p>
    So pygame currently has two major distributions, the original one and a fork
    of the project. What is a fork? Well it means it's a copy of the project, and
    in this case they branched off to be two completely separate packages now.
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="https://github.com/pygame-community/pygame-ce">pygame-ce</a> is a 
    fork of the original pygame, which got created due to all the active
    developers of the original project being banned by the "owner". The fork is not owned
    by any one person and follows a more democratic model to its management
  </p>
  <p>
    So what happened to all the active developers of the original pygame? They
    formed pygame-ce! That's right, so pygame-ce is being developed by the same
    people (and more) as the original pygame, and with a more democratic model
    have been able to push releases way more easily and introduce many more
    features.
  </p>
  <p>
    For all sane purposes, we will be using <code>pygame-ce</code> in this book
    and we advise the same. It has had more performance improvements, code
    features, and active development than the original pygame for a while now. 
  </p>

  <h2><a id="installation" class="js">Installation</a></h2>
  <p>
    Now that you know what pygame-ce is, let's install it.  

<pre>
  pip uninstall pygame
  pip install pygame-ce
</pre>

    In order for pygame-ce to work, pygame needs to be uninstalled first. 
    This is because both upstream pygame and pygame-ce share the import name, 
    and so upstream pygame must be removed <u>first</u>.
  </p>
  <p>
    I simply included it as the first step in order to install pygame-ce in a foolproof manner with no issues, 
    but I must remind you that a pre-requisite of using this site is knowing how to manage your 
    environment, so please do learn that if you havent already
  </p>
