  <p>In this article, we'll go over what pygame is and how to install it.</p>

  <h2><a id="introduction" class="js">Introduction</a></h2>
  <p>
    It's time to get started on your pygame journey, but what is pygame? Well
    pygame is "a free and open-source cross-platform library for the development
    of multimedia applications like video games using Python". As the
    description suggests, it's mostly used to make video games - which is why in
    this book we'll be learning techniques relevant to making games
  </p>

  <p>
    Pygame provides the very basic utility to draw and manipulate pixels on to
    the screen, much like <a href="https://www.libsdl.org/">SDL2</a>, but with
    extended features in various forms that makes it easier to use. Given this
    nature, you generally have a lot of control on how you want your code to
    run, so it may have a bit of a learning curve. But fear not! After reading
    this book you should be able to use pygame just fine, as long as you get
    your practice in ðŸ”«
  </p>

  <p>
    In this book we'll aim to cover how to do basic things with pygame, with
    little exercises in between to make sure you're not falling off, goodluck
  </p>

  <h2><a id="pygame-ce" class="js">Pygame-CE</a></h2>
  <p>
    So pygame currently has two major distributors, the original one and a fork
    of the project. What is a fork? Well it means it's a copy of the project, and
    in this case they branched off to be two completely separate packages now.
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="https://github.com/pygame-community/pygame-ce">pygame-ce</a> is the
    fork of the original pygame, which got created due to all the active
    developers of the original project being banned by the "owner". Well,
    pygame-ce has no "owner", it follows a more democratic approach to managing
    itself now.
  </p>
  <p>
    So what happened to all the active developers of the original pygame? They
    formed pygame-ce! That's right, so pygame-ce is being developed by the same
    people (and more) as the original pygame, and with a more democratic model
    have been able to push releases way more easily and introduce many more
    features.
  </p>
  <p>
    For all sane purposes, we will be using <code>pygame-ce</code> in this book
    and we advise the same. It has had more performance improvements, code
    features, and active development than the original pygame for a while now. It
    is recommended to use only <code>pygame-ce</code> from now onwards by most
    Python communities.
  </p>

  <h2><a id="installation" class="js">Installation</a></h2>
  <p>
    Now that you know what pygame-ce is, let's install it.  

{% highlight python %}
pip uninstall pygame
pip install pygame-ce
{% endhighlight %}
    In order for pygame-ce to work, pygame needs to be uninstalled first. 
    This is because both upstream pygame and pygame-ce share the import name, 
    and so upstream pygame must be removed <u>first</u>.
  </p>
  <p>
    I simply included it as the first step in order to install pygame-ce in a foolproof manner with no issues, 
    but I must remind you that a pre-requisite of using this site is knowing how to manage your 
    environment, so please do learn that if you havent already
  </p>
