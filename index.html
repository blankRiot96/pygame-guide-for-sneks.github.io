  <h1>Preface</h1>
  <p>
    "Where can I learn how to use pygame?" - one of the most commonly asked
    questions that we get. But we always struggle to answer. We sometimes point
    them to the docs and examples, but that isn't a comprehensive guide on
    building good pygame-based applications. There are many other tutorials and
    guides we have found, but we always find something lacking. There are many
    comments we give and many nitpicks we have - so much so that some of us
    gathered and decided to put all of them into a book. This book.
  </p>

  <h1>Prerequisites</h1>
  <p>
    So this book is meant for people who already know a bit of Python. Here's
    what you need to know:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Variables, loops and conditions</li>
    <li>Functions</li>
    <li>How objects work in Python</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    If you aren't familiar with the above, there are already some excellent
    pre-existing Python resources out there that we suggest depending on your
    situation
  </p>
  <h2>New to programming</h2>
  <p>
    If you're new to programming, here are some resources that are meant to
    teach you from the ground up
  </p>
  <h3>Text resources:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Automate The Boring Stuff</li>
    <li>A Byte of Python</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Video resources:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Corey Schafer's Python basics series</li>
    <li>Introduction to Python by Mike Dane</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Familiar with programming</h2>
  <p>
    If you're already familiar with programming, you probably don't want
    variables, loops, conditions and the like explained to you again, the
    <a href="">Official Python Tutorial</a> acts as a schema to the language
    while still being more expressive than documentation and covers the features
    of the language nicely
  </p>
